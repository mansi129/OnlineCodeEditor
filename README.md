# OnlineCodeEditor
 I've built a code editor using Node.js, Express.js, CodeMirror, and Compilex. It provides efficient coding with syntax highlighting, real-time editing, and direct code execution.

 ## Features
 - Syntax Highlighting: The editor highlights syntax for various programming languages, making code easier to read and understand.
 - Real-time Editing: Changes made to the code are reflected in real-time, providing instant feedback to the user.
 - Direct Code Execution: Execute your code directly within the editor and see the output instantly.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js, used to build the backend server.
- CodeMirror: A versatile text editor implemented in JavaScript for the browser, providing syntax highlighting and real-time editing capabilities.
- Compilex: A library for executing code in various programming languages.
